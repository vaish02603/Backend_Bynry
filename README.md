# StockFlow – Backend Assignment

This repository contains my solution for a backend case study
based on a B2B Inventory Management System.

## Structure
- `01_code_review/` – Code review and fixes for the product creation API
- `02_database_design/` – Database schema design and requirement analysis
- `03_api_implementation/` – Low stock alert API implementation

Some assumptions were made where requirements were not explicitly defined.
